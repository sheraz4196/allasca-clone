🧠 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. How long does a full home renovation usually take?

The duration depends on the project size and scope. A full home renovation typically takes 3 to 6 months, while smaller remodels like kitchens or bathrooms can take 6 to 10 weeks. We provide a clear timeline before starting and update you regularly throughout the process.

2. How much does a full home renovation cost in Toronto?

Costs vary widely based on materials, finishes, and square footage. On average, major home renovations in Toronto range from $150 to $350 per square foot. We provide a detailed, transparent quote after the initial design and consultation.

3. Do I need a building permit for my renovation?

Yes — if your project involves structural changes, wall removal, additions, or new plumbing/electrical systems, a permit is required. We handle all permit drawings and submissions directly with the City of Toronto to save you time.

4. What’s the difference between renovation and remodeling?

A renovation updates existing finishes or layouts without major changes, while a remodeling project can include structural changes, extensions, or complete redesigns. We offer both depending on your goals.

5. Can you help with design and construction together?

Absolutely. We’re a full-service design-build company, meaning we take care of both the creative design and the actual construction. This ensures faster timelines, fewer miscommunications, and a smoother process from start to finish.

6. What if I already have drawings or a designer?

No problem — we can work with your existing plans and help refine them to meet building code and zoning requirements. We also provide value-engineering suggestions to optimize design and cost.

7. Do you offer warranty or post-construction support?

Yes. All our projects include a comprehensive workmanship warranty. We also offer post-construction check-ins to ensure you’re fully satisfied with every detail even after completion.

8. Do you handle luxury or high-end home construction?

Yes, our portfolio includes modern, luxury, and custom-built homes across the GTA. We collaborate closely with clients to select premium finishes, fixtures, and architectural details that elevate every project.

9. Can I live in my home during renovation?

It depends on the project scope. For smaller renovations, yes — but for major structural or full-home projects, we recommend temporary relocation for safety and efficiency. We help plan logistics to minimize disruption.
