🧠 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. What is a Building Permit and why do I need one?

A building permit is an official approval from the City that ensures your construction or renovation complies with zoning by-laws and the Ontario Building Code. It’s required for most structural, plumbing, or layout changes — including basement finishes, additions, and new builds.

2. How long does it take to get a building permit in Toronto?

Typical permits take 2 to 6 weeks depending on project complexity. Minor renovations may be approved faster. We handle all City coordination to minimize delays and ensure compliance on the first submission.

3. What happens if I build without a permit?

Building without a permit can lead to stop-work orders, fines, and potential issues when selling or insuring your property. It’s always best to obtain permits to ensure safety and protect your investment.

4. How much does a building permit cost?

City fees vary depending on project size and scope — usually $250 to $3,000 for residential projects. Our team provides an upfront estimate during consultation and manages all payments directly with the City.

5. Can you help if my permit application was rejected?

Yes. We specialize in fixing rejected or delayed applications. Our experts review City comments, make necessary drawing revisions, and resubmit on your behalf to get fast approval.

6. Do I need a permit for interior renovations?

You typically need a permit if your renovation involves structural changes, removing or adding walls, new plumbing, or basement conversions. Cosmetic changes (painting, flooring, cabinets) usually don’t require one.
